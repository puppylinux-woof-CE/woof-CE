initrd_progs
============

programs, including busybox, statically linked for the initial ram disk

This should produce all the statically linked programs required for a Puppy Linux initrd.gz/xz

This is also a place for experimentation.

Usage
-----
Run `./build.sh` or `./build.sh -help` to see the available options

- hopefully a musl build environment is downloaded
- by default an attempt will be made to build all packages in the queue defined in build.conf
- for more options look in build.conf

The script can also generate an initrd.gz/xz file ready to test,
you can add these files to the to the main directory (will be copied to the initrd):
- DISTRO_SPECS (custom DISTRO_SPECS)
- init (custom init script)

BUGS
----
- some builds may need some fine tuning
- some builds might fail

Report any issues you find
