Woof-CE is a "Puppy builder". What this means is you can build your own custom
Puppy Linux live-CD from the binary packages of another distro.
Currently supported: Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, Arch, T2, Puppy
woof-CE has four directories.
woof-arch:  architecture-dependent (x86, arm) files, mostly binary executables.
woof-code:  the core of Woof. Mostly scripts.
woof-distro: distro-configuration (Debian, Slackware, etc.) files.
kernel-kit: scripts to download, patch, configure and build the kernel.

Information on the puppy building process with woof-CE can be found in 
README-FIRST, woof-code/README.txt and kernel-kit/README.
