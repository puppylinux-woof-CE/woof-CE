## About Puppy Linux

Puppy Linux is a unique family of Linux distributions meant for the home-user computers. It was originally created by 
[Barry Kauler](http://barryk.org/news) in 2003.

### Puppy Linux advantage

 1. Ready to use → all tools for common daily computing usage already included.
 2. Ease of use → grandpa-friendly certified ™
 3. Relatively small size → 200 MB or less.
 4. Fast and versatile.
 5. Customisable within minutes → remasters.
 6. Different flavours → optimised to support older computers, newer computers.
 7. Variety → hundreds of derivatives ("puplets"), one of which will surely meet your needs.

If one of these things interest you, read on.


### Yes, but what does it look like?

### First thing first

Puppy Linux is _not_ a single Linux distribution like Debian.
Puppy Linux is also _not_ a Linux distribution with multiple flavours,
like Ubuntu (with its variants of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc)
though it also comes in flavours.

Puppy Linux is **a collection of multiple Linux distributions**, built on
the _same shared principles_, built _using the same set of tools_, built on top 
of a _unique set of puppy specific applications and configurations_ and
generally speaking provide _consistent behaviours and features_, no 
matter which flavours you choose.

There are generally three broad categories of Puppy Linux distributions:

 * _official_ Puppy Linux distributions → maintained by Puppy Linux team,
   usually targeted for general purpose, and generally built using
   Puppy Linux system builder (called [_Woof-CE_][woof-ce]).

 * _woof-built_ Puppy Linux distributions → developed to suit specific needs 
   and appearances, also targeted for general purpose, and built using
   Puppy Linux system builder (called [_Woof-CE_][woof-ce]) with some additional
   or modified packages.

 * _unofficial_ derivatives (_"puplets"_) → are usually remasters 
   (or remasters of remasters), made and maintained by Puppy Linux enthusiasts,
   usually targeted for specific purposes.

> distribution. The choice of a binary compatible distribution determines the availability of
