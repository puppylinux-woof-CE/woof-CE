The .sfs in this iso are as follows:

adrv contains the web browser and can be replaced ##

fdrv contains a selection of firmware **

zdrv contains the kernel in association with vmlinuz

## the light web browser can be replaced by a more heavyweight browser such as
   Chromium or Firefox - see the forum for details

** To obtain a more comprehensive set of firmware download the latest sfs from:
   http://www.fishprogs.software/puppy/firmware-sfs/
   and rename it to the same fdrv name
