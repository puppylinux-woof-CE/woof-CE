Initial support for slackware-15.0 2021-07-02

Slackware 15 is not yet released but is likely to at some point within
the next few months so this support is to be considered _entirely
unstable_ !!! That said, it does boot to desktop (kit I've tried),
run well and connect and browse.

Many Puppy packages need to be rebuilt against the brand new Slackware
libs as they just don't run.

Also, this is designed to run with the new petbuild OTF system that runs
in 3builddistro, designed and fine tuned by @dimkr with a little bit of
input and bugfixing by myself. See:
https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/pull/1984
for a detailed rundown on what it does and how it was developed.

More to come :-)
