# eg: "s" is for slacko

## FATDOG style Kernel AKA "huge" kernel###
# if this option is set a FatDog style kernel is produced
# modules are split out of the kernel package and squashfs'd
# NOTE: all modules for booting must be builtins as none go into the initrd.gz
# Please make sure you use an appropriate DOTconfig
# 0 is off, 1 is on, default is not set
#FD=0
FD=1

### squashfs compression ###
# leave unset for the default of your mksquashfs binary
# run "mksquashfs --help" to find out options from compression
# for extra compression "-comp xz -Xbcj ia64" or "-comp xz -Xbcj x86" etc
# Consult the mksquashfs manual for more info.
COMP="-comp xz"

# Overide the default firmware URL ONLY FOR HUGE build
