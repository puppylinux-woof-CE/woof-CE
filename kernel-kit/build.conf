# this is the name of the pet package suffix, and source sfs
# name it whatever you like, usually put in a signifier for your distro
# eg: "s" is for slacko
package_name_suffix=k

# this is the kernel suffix hack, you can leave it empty ie: uname -r
# if you don't leave empty the leading "dash" is required
# example:
#custom_suffix=-4G
custom_suffix=Woof-CE

# this is the version of the vanilla kernel, usually latest is best
# or follow an LTS branch 
# THIS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEED CHANGING
# see kernel.org

## FATDOG Kernel ###
# if this option is set a FatDog style kernel is produced
# modules are split out of the kernel package and squashfs'd
# NOTE: all modules for booting must be builtins as none go into the initrd.gz
# Please make sure you use an appropriate DOTconfig
# 0 is off, 1 is on, default is not set
#FD=0
FD=1

### squashfs compression ###
# leave unset for the default of your mksquashfs binary
# run "mksquashfs --help" to find out options from compression
# for extra compression "-comp xz -Xbcj ia64" or "-comp xz -Xbcj x86" etc
# Consult the mksquashfs manual for more info.
COMP="-comp xz"
