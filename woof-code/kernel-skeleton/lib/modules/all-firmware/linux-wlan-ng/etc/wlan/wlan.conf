# Note:  To bind to a specific network, change the SSID to something different
#        and create the file /etc/wlan/wlancfg-<SSID> with your network-
#        specific settings.  If this file is not present, the settings in
#        /etc/wlancfg/wlancfg-DEFAULT are used.
#
# for example:
#    SSID_wlan0="linux-wlan"
# This expects a file called "/etc/wlan/wlancfg-linux-wlan" to be present.
#
# Use a SSID of "" to associate with any network in range.
