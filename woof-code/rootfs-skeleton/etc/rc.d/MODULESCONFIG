#unlike BOOTCONFIG and PUPSTATE that are auto-generated by Puppy,
#MODULESCONFIG was manually created and can be edited.
#MODULESCONFIG is read/written by the BootManager (System menu).

#Please use underscore '_' in all module names, not '-'.

#SKIPLIST: may need to simply skip some modules...
# skip all pci oss... btaudio es1371 i810_audio kahlua trident via82cxxx_audio
#usbmouse, usbkbd are not needed if usbhid is loaded. ub is bad, messes up usb_storage.
#note, make sure SKIPLIST has space chars on the beginning and end.
#note, BootManager will read/write this variable.
#note, rc.sysinit generates /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

#ADDLIST: if a module did not get auto-loaded but you know it is required for
#your hardware, add it to this list. Note, BootManager will read/write this.
#this variable is read at bootup by /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
#an entry is allowed to have parameters, replace ' ' with ':'. ex: "mmc_block:major=179"
