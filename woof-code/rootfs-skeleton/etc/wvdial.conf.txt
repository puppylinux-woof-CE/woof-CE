;
;wvdial.conf - wvdial configuration file  
;
;
;    DESCRIPTION
;
;When *wvdial* starts, it first loads its configuration from
;/etc/wvdial.conf, which contains basic information about the modem
;port, speed, and init string, along with information about your Internet
;Service Provider (ISP), such as the phone number, your username, and
;your password.
;
;The configuration file /etc/wvdial.conf is in Windows "ini" file
;format, with *sections* named in square brackets and a number of
;*variable = value* pairs within each section.
;Here is a sample configuration file:

[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyS2
Baud = 57600
Init = ATZ
Init2 = AT S11=50
Phone = 555-4242
Username = apenwarr
Password = my-password

[Dialer phone2]
Phone = 555-4243

[Dialer shh]
Init3 = ATM0

[Dialer pulse]
Dial Command = ATDP

;The sample configuration file above contains all of the options
;necessary to run the two sample command lines given above. Here is a
;complete list of settings that *wvdial* understands:
;
;Modem
;    The location of the device that *wvdial* should use as your modem.
;    The default is */dev/modem*. 
;Baud
;    The speed at which *wvdial* will communicate with your modem. The
;    default is 57600 baud. 
;Init1 ... Init9
;    *wvdial* can use up to nine initialization strings to set up your
;    modem. Before dialing, these strings are sent to the modem in
;    numerical order. These are particularly useful when specifying
;    multiple sections. See above for an example that uses Init3 to turn
;    the modem's speaker off. The default is "ATZ" for Init1. 
;Phone
;    The phone number you want *wvdial* to dial. 
;Dial Prefix
;    *wvdial* will insert this string after the dial command and before
;    the phone number. For example, to disable call waiting (in North
;    America, anyway) set this to "*70,". 
;Dial Command
;    *wvdial* will use this string to tell the modem to dial. The default
;    is "ATDT". 
;Login
;    You must set this to the username you use at your ISP. 
;Login Prompt
;    If your ISP has an unusual login procedure that *wvdial* is unable
;    to figure out, you can use this option to specify a login prompt.
;    When this prompt is received from your ISP, *wvdial* will send the
;    *Login* string. 
;Password
;    You must set this to the password you use at your ISP. 
;Password Prompt
;    If your ISP has an unusual login procedure that *wvdial* is unable
;    to figure out, you can use this option to specify a password prompt.
;    When this prompt is received from you ISP, *wvdial* will send the
;    *Password* string. 
;PPPD Path
;    If your system has pppd somewhere other than */usr/sbin/pppd*, you
;    will need to set this option. 
;Force Address
;    This option only applies if you have a static IP address at your
;    ISP, and even then you probably don't need it. Some ISP's don't send
;    the IP address as part of the PPP negotiation. This option forces
;    pppd to use the address you give it. 
;Remote Name
;    If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP authentication, you might need to
;    change this to your ISP's authentication name. In most cases,
;    however, it's safe to use the default value, "*". 
;Carrier Check
;    *wvdial* checks your modem during the connection process to ensure
;    that it is actually online. If you have a weird modem that insists
;    its carrier line is always down, you can disable the carrier check
;    by setting this option to "no". 
;Stupid Mode
;    When *wvdial* is in Stupid Mode, it does not attempt to interpret
;    any prompts from the terminal server. It starts pppd immediately
;    after the modem connects. Apparently there are ISP's that actually
;    give you a login prompt, but work only if you start PPP, rather than
;    logging in. Go figure. Stupid Mode is (naturally) disabled by default. 
;New PPPD
;    You need this option if you have pppd version 2.3.0 or newer, to
;    make wvdial create the file */etc/ppp/peers/wvdial*. This option is
;    enabled by default, thus if you have older pppd you need to set it
;    to `no' (or upgrade pppd). 
;Default Reply
;    When *wvdial* detects a prompt, and it hasn't seen any clues that
;    indicate what it should send as a response to the prompt, it
;    defaults to sending "ppp". Sometimes this is inadequate. Use this
;    option to override *wvdial*'s default prompt response. 
;Auto Reconnect
;    If enabled, *wvdial* will attempt to automatically reestablish a
;    connection if you are randomly disconnected by the other side. This
;    option is "on" by default. 
;Idle Seconds
;    Set the hangup timeout in seconds. If there is inactivity for the 
;    given time the connection is shut down. A hangup timeout of 0 
;    disables this feature.
