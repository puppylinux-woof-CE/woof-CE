echo "<b>$(gettext "Creating a profile")</b>
When you click on a button in the <b>Interfaces</b> section in the main window, you will be creating a connection to the Internet. The setup parameters for the connection will be saved as a 'profile'. Technical note: each profile is saved as one line in file /etc/simple_network_setup/connections, that can be opened and viewed with a text editor if you wish to see the inner details.

<b>Automatic connection</b>
At bootup, if SNS has been set as the default network handler, the connection profiles are used to automatically connect to the internet. Each of the profiles is tried, the wireless ones first, then wired, and the first successful connection is used.

If for some reason this auto-connection does not happen at bootup, for example a USB modem was not plugged in, you can click the <b>Connect Now</b> button in the main SNS window to perform a connection whenever you want. Alternatively, the 'connect' icon on the desktop has a right-click menu with an entry that does the same thing.

<b>Managing profiles</b>
It doesn't really matter if there are many profiles that don't work. When using a laptop at different places, or you plug in different network interface hardware, the old profiles can stay there in the 'connections' file. They will be automatically tested at bootup (or when you click the <b>Connect Now</b> button) and whichever one is found that works will be used.

However, if you accumulate more than 9-10 profiles and/or you know that some are not going to be needed again, it will make the auto-connect faster if they are removed -- see the appropriate <b>Delete</b> button." > /tmp/box_help
