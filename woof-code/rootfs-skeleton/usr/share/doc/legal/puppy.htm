        <h1>Puppy Linux Legal statements</h1>
This page explains various legal, licensing and distribution details 
related to Puppy Linux (also known as just "Puppy"), and all derivatives
 (Linux distributions based on Puppy).<br>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Very simple, use Puppy entirely at your own risk. Barry Kauler and other Puppy developers accept no liability
or responsibility whatsoever, and you use Puppy with this understanding.<br>
        <br>
All advice given on the official Puppy Linux web pages is given in good 
faith, but is given with a complete disclaimer of responsibility. It is 
entirely up to you, the user, to decide on the merit or otherwise of any
 advice, instructions, or program, and to take full personal 
responsibility for your decision.<br>
        <h2>Licenses</h2>
Puppy has software with a variety of licenses, mostly GPL or LGPL, some
closed-source (but free). The "Help" page (/usr/share/doc/index.html) in every
release of Puppy has this statement:<br>
<br>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Legal notice:</b></small><br>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I, Barry Kauler, established the
'Puppy Linux Project' in January 2003, first website and product
release 18-June-2003, and I have trademark claim to the name and typed
drawing of 'Puppy Linux', 'PuppyOS' and 'Puppy' as it relates to
"computer operating system software to facilitate computer use and
operation", under Federal and International Common Law and Trademark
Laws as appropriate.<br>
</small><small>Programs in Puppy are open source (except where noted above), and licenses of individual products
are duly acknowledged. </small><small>The
name </small><small>Puppy Linux", also known as </small><small>"Puppy" </small><small> and "PuppyOS", and all artisitic creations thereof, are
copyright (c) 2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008 Barry Kauler.</small><br>

Many of my web pages have an explicit legal message at the bottom, as
follows. However, if a page does not, it is still owned by myself and
all rights are reserved:<br>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(c) Copyright 2008 Barry Kauler, all reproduction rights reserved.<br>

</small></div>
My point of view is that a website is a "totality", an
artistic creation that includes the domain name. It is wrong to copy
some else's web pages to your own site, unless you have explicit
permission.<br>

        <br>

Please note that the images, names and typed drawings documented above
do not have to be explicitly registered as a trademark in your country.
In the USA, Federal registration is not required to establish rights in
a trademark, as Common Law rights arise from actual use of a mark. This
also applies to most other countries.<br>

Also in most countries, a (c) Copyright statement in any document or
artistic work is sufficient to reserve all rights to the owner, and the
work may not be reproduced without permission of the owner.<br>
        <h2>Derivatives</h2>
Any person is entitled to use Woof or the CD-remaster tool to build a 
derivative of one of the official releases of Puppy Linux, subject to 
the licensing restrictions and common courtesy. Derivatives are also 
known by the informal name of "puplets".<br>
        <br>
One basic request is that you choose a name for your distro that
provides sufficient "product differentiation" from "Puppy", "Puppy
Linux" and "PuppyOS". There is a thread on my archived News Blog that elaborates
on this:<br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://puppylinux.com/news/news202-210.htm#How_to_name_your_Puppy_distro">http://puppylinux.com/news/news202-210.htm#How_to_name_your_Puppy_distro</a> <br>
        <br>
Some acceptable names already in use are "GrafPup", "MeanPup" and
"Hacao Linux". There is even "Toutou Linux", which is the French word
for "puppy".<br>

        <br>

Another request is that your project site fully acknowledge myself,
Barry Kauler, as the original developer and current maintainer of Puppy
and there must be a link to my website, puppylinux.com, and to the community site puppylinux.org.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
Sincerely,<br>
Barry Kauler<br>
