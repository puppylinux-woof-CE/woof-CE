			<p>The main Puppy Linux Discussion Forum is hosted by team member <strong>rockedge</strong>. It started at the end of 2019 and has been the &quot;go to&quot; forum board for much of the community in recent times.
			</p>
			<p>This is the place where all the latest discussion happens so if you need help with any issue to do with Puppy, old or new, drop on by and someone will help you as soon as they can.

				Thanks to the generosity of John Murga, who also has developed a version of Puppy that fits in a 50M credit-card CD, this was our main Puppy Discussion Forum since 2005 until 2020.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately John Murga passed away in May 2020 and the old forum is preserved as his legacy to the Puppy community. It is now <em>read only</em>. There is a wealth of informaton at the old forum and is definitely worth browsing.
