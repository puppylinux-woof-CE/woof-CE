				<h1>HOWTO: Microsoft documents</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			We know that <i>Microsoft Office</i> is the defacto standard, so it is something we have to cope with. The most common problem is Word documents -- many business people will type a document using Word and then attach it to an email and expect the recipients to be able to view it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are links for all the programs which will help you create/view <i>Microsoft Office</i> files.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that 'portable' version of a program means that all the contents of the program will be located in a single directory, which many a times works better than regular installation.

			<h2>Abiword and Gnumeric</h2>
			<p>
				These 2 applications let you open and edit very simple *.doc and *.xls files.
				Abiword in particular should only be used for "simple" documents as it is known to have problems with more complex documents and a method of working using frequent saves should be employed.

			<h2>MS Fonts</h2>
