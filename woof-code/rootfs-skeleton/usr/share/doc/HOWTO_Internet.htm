			<h1>HOWTO: Internet access</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			I originally designed Puppy to access the Internet by conventional modem dialup to an ISP (Internet Service Provider). I now have a satellite broadband account (direct connection to a satellite via a dish on the roof). Broadband is of course very popular, but many people are still on dialup, either because they live where broadband is not available, broadband is too expensive, or they simply choose to remain with dialup.
