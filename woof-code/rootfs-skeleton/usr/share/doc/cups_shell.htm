				Your default browser should have opened (or will open after 3-30 seconds) with the CUPS web interface. Here you can add and configure your printer.
			</p>
			<p>
				IMPORTANT: If asked for a username and password, enter 'root' and 'woofwoof'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on <b>Manage Printers</b>, then <b>Add Printer</b>. Enter a name for your printer, e.g. <mark>HL1030</mark>. The <b>Location</b> and <b>Description</b> fields can be left blank. Click <b>Continue</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The steps after that should be straightforward, and hopefully you will find a printer driver that works for you. Finally you should see a message: <mark>Printer HL1030 has been added successfully</mark>.
			</p>
 			<p>
				Click on <b>Printers</b>, <b>Configure Printer</b> to change <b>Page Size</b> (if needed) and <b>Resolution</b> (600 DPI is good for most jobs). Click <b>Continue</b>, then <b>Printers</b> again. The <b>Printer State</b> should be <mark>idle, accepting jobs</mark>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, click <b>Print Test Page</b> to see if your printer works.

			<h2>Printer drivers</h2>
			<p>
				Puppy has the Gutenprint package, which has a lot of printer drivers. However, if your printer is not among them, you may be able to find a driver online.<br><br>
				The standard file format for a printer driver is <b>PPD</b> or <b>Postscript Printer Description</b>. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> has got a great article on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Printer_Description">PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files</a>, in case you are interested.<br><br>
				Two manufacturers with excellent support for Linux are <b>Brother</b> and <b>Hewlett Packard</b>, and Puppy enthusiasts have created PET packages for them. These can be found on the <a href="forums.htm">Puppy Linux forum</a> and some of the <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/">specific Puppy versions' repositories</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please read <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Printer_Description#CUPS">Wikipedia's 'PPD' page's 'CUPS' section</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most printer manufactures, now have Linux drivers for their printers, you can download from their specific driver support web sites.<br><br>
				Hewlett Packard has <b>Hpliplite</b> package for their printers. Specific solutions for other printers or more up-to-date packages, other manufactures will offer on their web sites.<br><br>
				People who use Puppy Linux also may provide a driver package for the printer you have.<br><br>
