			<h1>CUPS Web Interface Help</h1>
			<p>
				Your default browser should have opened (or will open after 3-30 seconds) with the CUPS web interface. Here you can add and configure your printer.
			</p>
			<p>
				IMPORTANT: If asked for a username and password, enter 'root' and 'woofwoof'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on <b>Manage Printers</b>, then <b>Add Printer</b>. Enter a name for your printer, e.g. <mark>HL1030</mark>. The <b>Location</b> and <b>Description</b> fields can be left blank. Click <b>Continue</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The steps after that should be straightforward, and hopefully you will find a printer driver that works for you. Finally you should see a message: <mark>Printer HL1030 has been added successfully</mark>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on <b>Printers</b>, <b>Configure Printer</b> to change <b>Page Size</b> (if needed) and <b>Resolution</b> (600 DPI is good for most jobs). Click <b>Continue</b>, then <b>Printers</b> again. The <b>Printer State</b> should be <mark>idle, accepting jobs</mark>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, click <b>Print Test Page</b> to see if your printer works.

			<h2>Printer drivers</h2>
			<p>
				Puppy has the Gutenprint package, which has a lot of printer drivers. However, if your printer is not among them, you may be able to find a driver online. For example, I needed a driver for my Brother HL2040 laser printer -- it was located, and I have put it permanently into Puppy -- look at /usr/share/cups/model/<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="file:///usr/share/cups/model/Brother-HL-2040-hl1250.ppd">Brother-HL-2040-hl1250.ppd</a> if you are curious what a printer driver file looks like. Note that the file has extension <b>.ppd</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two manufacturers with excellent support for Linux are <b>Brother</b> and <b>Hewlett Packard</b>, and Puppy enthusiasts have created PET packages of these.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of writing, the Hewlett Packard <b>Hpliplite</b> package is available in the official Puppy4 PET package repository (package created by MU). Just start the <b>Puppy Package Manager</b> (see Setup category in menu) and do a search for "hpliplite". This package supports a very wide range of Hewlett Packard printers and scanners.
