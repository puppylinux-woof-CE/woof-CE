			<h1>Announcement and release notes for DISTRO_NAME DISTRO_VERSION</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			DISTRO_NAME is built from a &quot;Puppy builder&quot; system named <i>Woof-CE</i> (<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE">woof-CE at GitHub</a>), which can build a Puppy Linux distribution from the binary packages of any other distro. There are many &quot;puppies&quot; built with Woof, including TahrPup, Precise<a href="#legacy"><sup>*</sup></a>, Wary<a href="#legacy"><sup>*</sup></a>, Racy<a href="#legacy"><sup>*</sup></a>, and Slacko.<br>
			Each "Puppy distro" built by Woof-CE is a distinctive distribution in its own right, with unique features. You choose a puppy based on your particular needs, be it specific hardware, software, or access to and compatibility with the package repositories of a particular major distro.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since November 2013 Puppies are built with <a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE">woof-CE</a>. There are no release notes for woof-CE at this stage however anyone is free to browse the commits and offer code in the form of a &quot;pull request&quot;.<br>
			The following is left here for historical purposes and still has much relevance.
