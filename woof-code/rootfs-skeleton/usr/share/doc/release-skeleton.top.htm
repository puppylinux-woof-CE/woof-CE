			<h1>Announcement and release notes for DISTRO_NAME DISTRO_VERSION</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			DISTRO_NAME is built from a &quot;Puppy builder&quot; system named <i>Woof-CE</i> (<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE">Woof-CE at GitHub</a>), which can build a Puppy Linux distribution from the binary packages of another distro.<br>There are many &quot;puppies&quot; built with Woof-CE using, for example, components from Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware and Arch.<br>
			Each "Puppy distro" built by Woof-CE is a distinctive distribution in its own right, with unique features. You choose a puppy based on your particular needs, be it specific hardware, software, or access to and compatibility with the package repositories of a particular major distro.
