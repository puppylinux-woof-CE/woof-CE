This directory is specifically for SVG format icons unique to Puppy Linux. 
By tradition they are to be kept as small (in file size) as practical.

The zigbert guidelines:
- Let height and width be 100px
  This makes it easy to scale all icons the by the same factor.
- Icon colors is mainly gray with pale blue/yellow highlights.
  Red is only used for 'danger' or negative info as cancel/no/error/...
  Green is positive feedback.
  Exceptions are found - for compatibility with existing gtk-theme.
- To keep the files as small as possible, it is recommended to write them by hand.
  A drawing program like inkscsape will create huge files compared to the ones you find here.
