[general]
#3buildistro script in Woof separates out the sections into separate early-boot translations.
#for example the [init] section becomes file /locales/de/init in the initrd, and 
#the target file (that gets translated at bootup) is /init (the init script translates
#itself at startup, and knows where the translation files are located).
#Please type translation only between the last two % characters. For example: s%"done"%"fertig"%
#Keep all formatting exactly the same, that is retain all " ' < > / \ characters.
# -- do not replace the " and ' with left-side or right-side quote characters.
#Keep all variables as-is, exs: ${DROPOUT} $DROPOUT -- do not translate!

[init]
#These are translations for 'init' in the initrd. It is a translation at every bootup.
#3builddistro (in Woof) creates /locales/de/init in the initrd, and 'init' at bootup
#reads it and translates itself (if LANG is de*).
