#A GUI when start desktop first time, to replace the text-mode dialogs (locale, keyboard-layout, timezone)
#inspired by shinobar's countrywizard.qs (firstrun), but a complete rewrite.
#replaces the old single-purpose scripts: chooselocale timezone-set (now symlinks)
#propose first startup, run 'quickcountry, which is symlink.
#111019 first version.
#111020 'countrywizard', 'xrandrshell' now symlinks to 'quicksetup'.
#111022 even though LANG=en_US.UTF-8, localedef still creates /usr/lib/locale/en_US.utf8. use UTF8=.utf8
#111025 thanks to thunor, fix for window dimensions.
#111026 added button for dead mouse.
#111027 fix Xorg.0.log records 'intel' driver loading twice.
#111027 tweaked text messages very slightly.
#111027 first boot, /etc/localtime does not exist, so must set timezone.
#111103 other entries in Etc dir.
#111107 changed 'comboboxtext' to 'combobox' tag, but does not support 'default' tag.
#111111 revert to 'comboboxtext' due to heavy cpu usage, but not 'default' -- do not get the double-popup problem.
#111113 upgraded gtk to 2.24.8, fixed slowness. go back to 'combobox'.
#111113 fix timezone-set cli app.
#120209 scripts fixdesk and fixmenus translate files to new language (as specified in /usr/share/sss/menu_strings and desk_strings).
#120213 when locale change, inform if langpack PET needed.
#120215 offer to translate initrd.
#120215 rc.country calls 'chooselocale cli quiet', to run localedef without asking any questions or popups.
#120216 insert /PUPPYKEYMAP into initrd. moved SET_KEYBOARD before SET_LOCALE processing.
#120216 call 'lang2initrd'
#120224 load console font. (code based on that in 'init')
#120226 redraw desktop drive icons when resolution changes (or may change, in the case of running xorgwizard).
#120227 set hostname, but only if ethernet auto-connected at 1st boot.
#120228 L18L: enabling adding locale without utf8 using regexp.
#120301 no, don't load console font here. seems to get dropped on exit from X. (instead, do it in xwin. now have /sbin/load_consolefont)
#120305 check if langpack available in noarch repo.
#120311 change persistence logic for 120227.
#120313 hardcode translations for popup if user changes locale.
#120313 restrict network frame to only be in main quicksetup window.
#120315 dutch (nl) hardcode translation for locale-change popup. added pt, es, it.
#120328 have rewritten rc.country, try to make chooselocale compatible. 120330 bugfix.
#120331 added Polish (pl) hardcoded translation.
#120401 change logic to call lang2initrd.
#120402 expand locale help window.
#120524 Please wait... msg after click ok button.
#120625 always display network frame, remove set-hostname button, added firewall and ntp checkboxes.
#120627 support kbd pkg.
#120708 'quickarm' symlink to 'quicksetup', for booting on arm boards. see also /etc/rc.d/BOOTCONSTRAINED and /usr/sbin/delayedrun.
#120714 revert 120708. instead, read BOOT_BOARD to determine type of board booting off. support raspberry pi audio settings.
#120717 remove XPID=""
#120901 /usr/share/zoneinfo layout has changed (ubuntu precise).
#130131 xrandr may have more than one frequency on a line, ex:   1360x768       59.8     60.0
#130202 130131 not enough. xrandr was not setting chosen vertical frequency.
#130203 fix insertion of fontsize in xml.
#130506 detect current xorg driver broken, use same code as in /usr/sbin/report-video.
#130511 hostname-set now may return value 2.
#130701 network frame now always displayed. added checkbox for run apps as spot.
#131121 fix the xrandr resolution and refresh rates, displays all now, 01micko.
#131121 fix numerous calls to sed and replace many cut calls with bash, KRG
#131230 zigbert: gui (gtkdialog) improvements.
#170609 crda wireless country selection, ref: http://barryk.org/news/?viewDetailed=00409.

После того, как у вас появится подключение к Интернет нажмите значок \\Zbinstall\\ZB на рабочем столе для запуска Менеджера пакетов Puppy, затем выберите репозитарий и категорию.
Примечание: Перед загрузкой пакета локализации вы должны будете настроить подключение к Интернет и использовать Менеджер пакетов Puppy на английском. Если вы думаете, что не знаете английский достаточно хорошо, альтернатива - это запуск другой операционной системы, зайдете на http://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/pet_packages-noarch и загрузите пакет локализации. После этого загрузите Puppy, нажмите на значок раздела на рабочем столе для монтирования раздела (на который вы загрузили пакет локализации), затем кликните на сам PET-пакет лангпака для его установки."

Возможно пакет для вашего языка в разработке на форуме Puppy (будте осторожны, пакеты для старых версий Puppy не подходят). Или, возможно, вы захотите помочь и создать пакет -- Кликните Меню -> Справка -> HOWTO Internationalization (конечно же вам будет нужно хорошее знание английского языка)."

Вы можете сделать это в любое время в будущем.

Note: Before downloading the langpack, you will have to make an Internet connection and use the Puppy Package Manager in English. If you think that you cannot read English sufficiently, an alternative is to run another operating system, go to http://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/pet_packages-noarch and download the langpack.

Perhaps there is one under development in the Puppy Forum (be careful, some older versions of Puppy have incompatible langpacks).
