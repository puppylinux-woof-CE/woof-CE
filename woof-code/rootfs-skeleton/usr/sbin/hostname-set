#this is called from Internet Connection Wizard, script ''.
#111028 have copied dlg code inside 'connectwizard' script, then call here with hostname passed param.
#111028 fully internationalised.
#111103 gcmartin: accept '-' char in hostname.
#111103 gcmartin: current hostname is $HOSTNAME, but if rerun this script before restarting X, need to get from /etc/hostname.
#111106 fix passed hostname from connectwizard.
#111117 shinobar: fix.
#120227 can also be called from quicksetup. now have exit #
#120505 when hostname changed, also need to restart network connection. ref: http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=77743
#130511 shinobar: reconnect only if local dynamic DNS is available. See my modification near bottom of script.
