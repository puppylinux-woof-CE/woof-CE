The most common reason is you have used the Puppy Universal Installer (see 'Setup' menu) to install Puppy to a USB Flash 'key' drive, but the PC refuses to boot from it.

This is a solution for such cantankerous PCs, but of course is not applicable if you have a modern sans-floppy-drive PC.\"`</label></text>
 <text><label>`gettext \"Note, if you need to boot Puppy installed in a Linux partition (ext2, ext3, reiserfs, or minix), it is possible to create a GRUB boot floppy and this can be done when the 'Puppy Universal Installer' (in 'Setup' menu) is executed, or by selecting 'GRUB bootloader config' from the 'Control Panel' menu.\"`</label></text>
