#BK updated may 2007 for 2.16.
#BK updated v2.22, sync with rc.shutdown multisession bugfix.
#v3.01: BK 11 oct 2007, removed multisavefunc() to /etc/rc.d/functions4puppy.
#v412 /etc/DISTRO_SPECS, renamed pup_xxx.sfs, pup_save.2fs etc.
#v555 pup files renamed to woofr555.sfs, woofsave.2fs.
#w482 use xorriso instead of cdrtools/cdrkit if installed.
#120323 partial replace 'xmessage' with 'pupmessage'.

#/etc/rc.d/rc.shutdown saves session at shutdown, savesession-dvd is called
#from desktop icon to do an immediate save to multisession-cd.

#w482 use xorriso if it is installed (see also functions4puppy)...
