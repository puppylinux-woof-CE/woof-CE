#This script will create a PET package.
#Just create a directory with the name of the package, for example 'abiword-0.5.6'
#and put what you want in it.
#It should have abiword-0.5.6/usr/share/applications/abiword.desktop if the
#application requires a menu entry, but if there isn't one this script will ask
#some simple questions and create one.
#This script will also create abiword-0.5.6/pet.specs, which has
#some information useful to the Puppy Package Manager.
#w476, w478 fixes to work with petspec.
#w482 if preexisting pet.specs, read fields from it.
#100201 improve reading of pet.specs
#100303 fix bug detection arch-dependent pkg.
#130305 rerwin: ensure package tmp directory, if any, has all permissions.
#131122 support xz compressed pets (see installpkg.sh, pet2tgz)
#131123 changed default to gzip, will change it back in a year or 2
#141011 add command line args for unattended builds
#160524 rerwin: correct search for top category in hierarchy.
#160803 rerwin: correct pet.specs path; sync compression default; simplify parameter parsing.
#160919 01micko: add -C option to change compression default.

Usage: dir2pet [option]... [<name-of-dir>]

Create a compressed file containing the content of a directory

Options:
  -h, --help			   show this help
  -C, --change-compression-default Change the default compression
				   (gz or xz, currently '"$comp"')

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic:
  <name-of-dir>	the directory, not path, to be packaged.
		THIS IS THE PACKAGE.
		(Omit if specified with -p option)

  EXAMPLE:
    # dir2pet my_fun_game-0.1-i486

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced:
  -s		   skip all questions - for package build scripts
  -p=<name-of-dir> directory to be packaged. THIS IS THE PACKAGE.

The following options are only useful with the "-s" option.
For best results, use as many as possible:

Compression: (use only one, default if none chosen is \"$comp\")
  -x	use xz (high) compression
  -g	use gz (low) compression

Non-compulsory:
  -k      keep pet.specs / do not overwrite it
  -n                    no distro information
  -i="<repo> [version]" override default distro info
                        -i="noarch"
                        -i="debian stretch"
                        -i=""
  -w="<description>" quoted description of the application
  -d=<+deps>	     comma-delimited dependencies, with prepended
		     "+" sign
  -c=<Category>	     category of application, for package manager -
		     allowed categories:
			BuildingBlock (default)
			Desktop
			System
			Setup
			Utility
			Filesystem
			Graphic
			Document
			Business
			Personal
			Network
			Internet
			Multimedia
			Fun
