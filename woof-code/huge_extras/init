#101101 fix load zdrv if in humongous initrd.
#101102 zdrv.sfs was not getting loaded for PUPMODE=6/7 (save to entire partition).
#101103 ignore any session saved to entire partition if puppy installed in a subdir.
#101103 maybe network boot, no local vmlinuz.

#101218 if boot from cd with 'pfix=ram', do not search other drives (do not want to load puppy.sfs off hd).
#110114 if a drive unplugged in previous boot, but plugged in at bootup, device-nodes will be missing in main f.s...

#110116 shinobar: do not change PUPMODE 6 to 7, 12 to 13, if extern usbhd.
#110122 bypass update code, maybe causes more trouble than worth it. Rely on /etc/rc.d/update for all updating.
#110126 restored support for /proc/ide, device nodes /dev/hd*.
#110204 110205 110206 bug fixes: booting ide kernel, copying .sfs to sub-folder. warning: busybox grep -F different from full grep.

#110426 move done/failed 2 places to right (also in rc.sysinit script).
#110509 fix for 'grep -f filename' where filename was empty only one LF char.
#110521 also convert bytes to kb.
#110710 handle kernel with usb driver built-in, and/or without my usb-drive-discovery patch (2.6.34+).
#110722 fix deleting of old boot scripts.
#110810 some builds may have many scsi drivers in initrd, if needed will have already loaded, so delete them.

#111003 ldolse: pemasu 2.6.39 kernel showing usb at also ata, causing double writes to /tmp/PUPSAVES.
#111120 workarounds for missing support utilities: fusermount (no longer needed), e2fsck, resize2fs

#121227 more f.s. drivers as modules, need to load (see also 3builddistro).
#130128 support udf f.s.
#130211 ntfs-3g needs "silent" option.
#130216 preliminary support for f2fs. note, guess_fstype binary updated for f2fs, not yet busybox.
#130513 if we find a rw f.s., create pupdesk.flg. only needed in PUPMODE=5, see /usr/sbin/quicksetup.
#130514 shinobar: extra sfs in the order of EXTRASFSLIST.
