#2createpackages has already built the generic packages in packages-$DISTRO_FILE_PREFIX/.
#these packages have generic names as specified in the second field of PKGS_SPECS_TABLE,
#which is a variable in ./DISTRO_PKGS_SPECS. The format of entries in table:
# yes|abiword|abiword,abiword-common|exe,dev,doc,nls
# ...if first field is 'yes' then it will be built into distro.
