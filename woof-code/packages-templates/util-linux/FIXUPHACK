#usr/bin/strings is not part of util-linux -- i checked sources of various versions, at
# http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/
#see also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux
#however, slackware binary pkg does have it.
#strings is actually in pkg binutils, but slackware have renamed that 'strings-GNU'.
#all other distros use the 'strings' in pkg binutils.
