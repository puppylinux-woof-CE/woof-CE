PLEASE NOTE:-
--------------------

The *recommended* location for this portable application is in /mnt/home. If you place your portable in /mnt/home, when adding the MenuEntry it will sym-link the 'LAUNCH' script into /usr/bin, place a .desktop entry in /usr/share/applications, and an icon in /usr/share/pixmaps. It will then restart "X", in order that the MenuEntry will show up in the Menu.

Specific advice for Chromium-based browsers:-
------------------------------------------------------------

CAUTION: make sure to use the appropriate 'MenuAdd' script for your Puppy. 'MenuAdd-Old' is for Bionicpup64 and older; 'MenuAdd-New' is for Fossapup64 and newer. This ensures the correct 'LAUNCH' script is sym-linked into /usr/bin. 

It should launch without issue.

However; IF you wish to place the portable application in a different location, that's not a problem. First, use the 'MenuRemove' script to remove the existing MenuEntry. Let the desktop settle after "X" has restarted, then move the portable to the desired location. Finally, re-add the MenuEntry with the appropriate 'Menu-Add' script.

The MenuEntry removal/re-adding steps are necessary because Linux does not, under normal circumstances, permit the migrating of links from one location/file-system to another. 'Soft' links will lose their 'target', and hard links can no longer locate the specified inode. Therefore, the MenuEntry needs to be re-created from its new location.

None of these steps take long to perform, and add another layer of convenience, since with a .desktop file you can also add the application to the QuickLaunch area of the tray, etc.
