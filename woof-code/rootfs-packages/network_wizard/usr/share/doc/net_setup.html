          	The network setup wizard will help you connect to an wired ethernet
            or wireless network.
          </P>
          <P>
          	It works with most network adapters and configurations but not with
          	all of them. Please note that not all adapters work the same way.
          	Some may require additional steps.
          </P>
          <P>
          	If you are new to networking please read the 
          	<A HREF="#glossary">glossary</A> so	you can understand the 
          	explanations that follow.
          </P>
          <P>
          	This document will not tell you all there is to know about networks,
          	or how to set-up a network, just how to connect to an existing network.
          </P>
          <P>
          	The steps you'll have to follow to connect to the network are:
						<OL>
							<LI>
								Ensure that there is a driver loaded for your adapter so 
								Puppy can see it as a valid device (a.k.a an "interface").
							</LI>
							<LI>If you have wireless: set up the wireless parameters</LI>
							<LI>Assign an IP address to your device.</LI>
							<LI>
								Select if you want this configuration to be used the next
								time you start Puppy.
							</LI>
						</OL>
          </P>
          <P>
          	Those simple steps are explained in more detail throughout this document.
          </P>
          <P>
          	If you have trouble connecting
          	to your network, you can ask for help on the Puppy forum following
          	the link from the <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/forums.htm">main Puppy page</a>

          <H2 CLASS="hd2">Loading Drivers</H2>
          <P>
          	Sometimes puppy can identify your particular adapter and load
          	a driver automatically. If this was the case you will see an
          	interface listed in the Interfaces section, along with the
          	driver used and a button to configure the interface. Lucky you!
          </P>
          <P>
          	If you don't see a driver or a device that corresponds to the adapter you 
          	want to use you will have to load it manually.
          </P>
          <P>
          	To manually load a driver you will first need to know what driver 
          	you need. For this you will need the adapter brand, model and version.
          	Once you have this information, you can try the following options to find out your driver:
          </P>
					<UL>
						<LI>
							Go to the adapter's documentation or the manufacturer's web site 
							and look for either the driver name or the chipset.
						</LI>
						<LI>
							Try pressing the "Load module" button and see if any of the descriptions mentions your adapter.
						<LI>
							Search on the Internet using the adapter brand, model and version.
						</LI>
						<LI>
							Ask in the Puppy forum. Always provide as much information as
							you can about your adapter or chipset.
						</LI>
					</UL>
          <P>
          	Now that you know what driver you need:
          </P>
          <OL>
            <LI>On the main window of the wizard click on the "Load module" button</LI>
            <LI>Select the driver from the list</LI>
            <LI>Click OK</LI>
