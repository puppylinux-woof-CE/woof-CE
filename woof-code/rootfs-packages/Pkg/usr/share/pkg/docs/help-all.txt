This a package manager for finding, downloading & installing software 
packages from a variety of sources. ${APPNAME:-Pkg} can also convert 
packages, build tar archives, combine packages, analyse dependencies, 
compile packages from source code and more. 

You can use TAB completion with ${APPNAME:-Pkg} in order to complete 
package names from either the current repo, or all repos, depending on 
your settings (see $PKGRC),

All packages can be searched for, but if using \`${SELF:-pkg} --get PKGNAME\` 
then packages which are already installed will not be re-installed. 
You can manually re-install them using the --force option.

In $PKGRC there are settings for current repo info, search 
settings, and so on. By default, '${APPNAME:-Pkg}' searches only the 
current repo unless told to do otherwise. You can list all repos 
and switch repos easily (see options below).

All files are downloaded to $WORKDIR/, and all files that have been 
converted end up there as well. You should ideally move any packages 
you create to another directory.

The list of repo 'sources' (all repos available on your system) can 
be updated by using \`${SELF:-pkg} --add-source\` (or by manually editing 
$HOME/.pkg/sources-all). Then run \`${SELF:-pkg} --update-sources\` and 
${APPNAME:-Pkg} will support any repos added in sources-all. Each repo 
needs a name, filetype, a repo file in '$HOME/.packages/' named 
'Packages-*-*' or 'livepackages*.txt' etc, and some other options.

ABOUT PACKAGE NAMES:

With online repositories, you don't need to give the file extension.

If the package is 'downloaded' (in $WORKDIR), you won't need to give 
the path, only the filename. To check if PKGNAME is downloaded, 
just enter: ${SELF:-pkg} -ld PKGNAME

PIPING STUFF:

You can also pipe stuff to ${APPNAME:-Pkg}, just give a dash (-) as the 
last option. 

The general syntax is this:	echo \"\$PKG_LIST\" | ${SELF:-pkg} [OPTIONS] -
You can pipe recursively:  	${SELF:-pkg} -li | ${SELF:-pkg} [OPTIONS] -
 
If only a dash was given, ${APPNAME:-Pkg} will either install or uninstall 
each package, depending on whether or not the package is installed:

 echo \"\$PKGLIST\" | ${SELF:-pkg} -

You can give multiple packages by encasing them in double quotes (\"\")

 ${SELF:-pkg} g \"PKG1 PKG2\"		download & install PKG1 and PKG2, plus deps
 ${SELF:-pkg} u \"PKG1 PKG2\"		uninstall multiple packages from the system
 ${SELF:-pkg} d \"PKG1 PKG2\"		download multiple packages from the repo
 ${SELF:-pkg} pb \"PKG1 PKG2\"		compile, build & install multiple pkgs
 ${SELF:-pkg} li \"PKG1 PKG2\"		list installed pkgs matching PKG1 or PKG2

Below are the command line options you can pass to ${APPNAME:-Pkg}, 
with examples at the end.
