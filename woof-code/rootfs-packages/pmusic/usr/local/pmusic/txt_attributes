Usage: pmusic [OPTION(S)] [FILE(S) / DIR(S) / URL(S)]

  "pmusic /path/file.mp3" will add file to playqueue if pmusic is already
  running. If not running, pmusic will start with empty playqueue and play file.
  To override this dynamic behavior, use the -a/-P switch.


Options

  -a             Add [FILE(S) / DIR(S) / URL(S)] to playqueue instead of playing it
  -b             Use pMusic as backend - no GUI
  -B             Use only backend - do not interfere with playqueue, etc.
                 This works as a dead simple command-line player
  -c             Loads CD-audio disc into playqueue and starts playing
  -D             List pMusic dependencies and if installed on your system
  --debug        Show debugging messages
  --dump-gtk     Print the gtk-code (xml) and exit
  -f             List supported audio formats
  -h, --help     Show this help message
  -i INFO        Show info about playing track
                   albumart   - show album art in defaultimageviewer
                   nowplaying - Return playing artist - title
                   path       - Return full path of playing track
  -j             Do NOT save PMUSIC_FRONTEND settings (like geometry, ...)
                 Handy in combination with -p
  -p FRONTEND    Use this frontend instead of the one defined in rc
                 Available frontends are stored in /usr/local/pmusic/frontends/
  -P             Ensure that the defined file will start playing
  -r             Add all supported files in directories recursively
  --reset        Start pMusic like a fresh install.
                 But keep most personal settings.
  -s SIGNAL      Send signal to a running instance of pMusic
                   balleft    - increase balance left by 10%
                   balright   - increase balance right by 10%
                   mute       - Turn volume On/Off 
                   next       - Play next song in playqueue
                   pause      - Pause/Play audio
                   prev       - Play previous song in playqueue
                   quit       - Quit all pmusic processes
                   stop       - Stop playing
                   volup      - increase volume by 10%
                   voldown    - derease volume by 10%
  -t xx:xx       Set the start time offset
                 This does not work with the -a switch
  -T THEME       Set graphical theme for this instance only 
  -U MILLISEC    Set update interval for progressbar +++
                 This is useful to reduce cpu-hunger on low-powered systems
                 Default is 1000 = 1 sec
  -v, --version  Show pMusic version
