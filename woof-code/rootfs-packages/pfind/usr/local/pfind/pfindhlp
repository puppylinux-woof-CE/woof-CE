<b>[OR]</b> Filename/content must contain either 'this [OR] that'. This will give more results.
<b>[AND]</b> Filename/content must contain both 'this [AND] that'. This will give less results.
<b>*</b> Means anything. 'pup*back' finds both 'PuppyBackup' and 'Puppies are back'.
<b>?</b> Means any char. 'pup??back' finds only 'PuppyBackup'. '??' represent only two chars."
