# 130812 Modification as pgprs version 1.5 by Richard Erwin for Puppy integration,
#  to obtain APN, PIN and dialup number from separate files in chatscripts
#  directory; changed name to gprs...chat and moved to chatscripts (without
#  "exec chat...").
#
# File: 
# /etc/ppp/chatscripts/gprs-connect-chat

#The PIN code is obtained from file /etc/ppp/chatscripts/gprs-cpin_command by way of the "@" technique.
#The APN code is obtained from file /etc/ppp/chatscripts/gprs-cgdcont_command by way of the "@" technique.
#
# Description: 
# chat script to open Radiolinjas GPRS service with GPRS phones. If ppp 
# negotiation stalls, try restarting the phone. To try with other GPRS 
# operator setting, change the PDP contex setting. The settings work with 
# most Ericsson models, but Nokia 8310 and 30 do not support QoS parameters 
# with AT commands, so just delete those lines and it'll work.
#
# Set PDP context CID=1, protocol=IP, APN=icecelular:
# AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","icecelular","",0,0
#
# Set CID=1 QoS requirements from the network, not supported by Nokia:
# AT+CGQREQ=1,0,0,0,0,0
#
# Set CID=1 minimum acceptable QoS parameters, not supported by Nokia:
# AT+CGQMIN=1,0,0,0,0,0
#
# 'Call' CID=1 (activate PDP context one, perform GPRS attach):
# ATD*99***1#
#
# Some phones like the Orange SPV (yes, the Microsoft Smartphone) use this 
# dial string to start GPRS connection:
# ATD*99#
#
# The actual chat script:
