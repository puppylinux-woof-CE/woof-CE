## Puppy Linux Team

Puppy Linux team is you! Yes, you. No, this is not a joke. 

If you are a member of the Puppy Linux community, then you are a member 
of the Puppy Linux Team. Membership is automatic. What you choose to
do as a member is the Team is up to you. You can choose to just use
Puppy Linux team and do nothing else. That is fine. You can also 
choose to contribute back to Puppy Linux. That is also fine, but it is
not a requirement.

Puppy Linux Team works on [do-ocracy](https://communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy)
principle. Something will be done if any of the team members feel the 
itch to do that something.

### Contributing back

There are many ways to contribute back what you receive from Puppy Linux.

1. If you are good at writing, help to write some documentation about
   Puppy Linux. Or help keeping this website current.
   
2. If you are good at arts, you can always contribute artworks 
   (background pictures, icons, icon themes, colour themes, audio
   themes).
   
3. If you're good at video publishing, help to create some sort of videos
   about Puppy Linux (marketing, inspirational, educational, etc) and
   upload it to common video sharing websites such as Puppy Linux.

4. If you have some extra space in your server hosting, help
   to mirror Puppy Linux files.
   
5. If you're good at troubleshooting, stand by in the forums and support
   people who ask for help.
   
6. If you're good at coding, help to improve various programs used in
   Puppy Linux.
   
7. And so it goes. Whatever talent you have, there is 
   always something that you can do to improve Puppy Linux and its
   community. 
   
Yes, you are always invited. And you are always welcome.



### Organisation Structure

There isn't any. 

Over the years, there have been calls to formulate
a formal organisational structure. Barry has always been resistant to
this; he always prefers the fluid nature of the hivemind of the community
to direct the future of Puppy. This worked well when he was still in
charge - he was the dictator and had the final say on what went in and
what didn't; in order word he brought order on the hivemind's chaos.

You would expect that after he stepped down the community would explode
with unrestrained chaos. 

But it did not.

Barry left an important legacy to the community: The Puppy Linux build 
system known as _"Woof"_ (and renamed to "Woof-CE" 
(Woof _Community Edition_) when it taken over by the community).
A distribution that wishes to carry the name of "Puppy Linux" must be
created from this build system. There is a lot flexibility in this
build system; and developers and maintainers can even modify the process
to suit their own - but for something to be called "Puppy Linux", it
must be built from Woof-CE.

Thus Woof-CE is the defining factor of Puppy Linux. Woof-CE is published
out in the open, on [github.com](https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE).
Everybody can contribute it; and contribution that goes in to Woof-CE
will automatically become a feature of future Puppy Linux.

In a way, Woof-CE played the same role as what Barry did in the past:
which feature will make it into Puppy Linux, and which one will not.

Who then decides what goes into Woof-CE?




### Stewards of the Puppy Linux

Despite the lack of organisational structure and the hivemind operations
of the Puppy Linux Team, there still needs someone or two who are
directly responsible for various practical and operational Puppy Linux 
activities.
For example, someone needs to have control over the domain name and
renew them when it is due. Someone needs to have control over the web
server used to host puppy linux stuff. Someone needs to decide whether
to accept proposed changes to Woof-CE. Etc, you get the point.

The people who are trusted to do these activities are called 
"stewards" of Puppy Linux. They hold the key for various operational
activities. This is not a single person, there are different
stewards for different activities.

Stewards come and go. Current stewards may have various reasons that
prevent him or her continue with his/her task; or require lengthy
time of absence; in this situation he/she will be replaced by someone
who can be more responsive.

Stewards are not democratically elected. They are instead appointed by 
the existing stewards based on the revered do-ocracy principle. 
If you contribute a lot of things, expect that someday
you will be asked to become a steward yourself. If you don't, then
don't expect that making a lot of noises and demands will make you one.
